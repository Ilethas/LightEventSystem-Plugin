# Light Event System

**Light Event System** enables you to send and receive `UObject`-based events in both C++ and Blueprint. It's an implementation of the [Observer pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observer_pattern) in the Unreal Engine ecosystem.

See the [documentation website](https://light-event-system.pages.dev/) to learn how to use the plugin.
